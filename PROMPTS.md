# AI Prompts Used in Development

This document contains all AI prompts used during the development of this Cloudflare AI application. AI-assisted coding was used throughout the project to accelerate development and ensure best practices.

## Project Planning & Architecture

### Initial Project Setup
I need to build a Cloudflare AI application for an assignment with these requirements:

- LLM integration using Llama 3.3 on Workers AI

- Workflow coordination using Workers or Durable Objects

- User input via chat interface

- Memory/state management

- Must use free tier only (student project)

- Repository name must start with cf_ai_

Help me design the overall architecture and understand what components I need to implement.


### Technology Stack Selection
For my Cloudflare AI application, help me choose between these options:
WebSocket vs HTTP for real-time communication
Durable Objects vs external database for state storage
TypeScript vs JavaScript for development speed
Framework vs vanilla JavaScript for the frontend

Consider that this is a student project with limited time and must stay within free tier limits.


## Configuration & Setup

### Wrangler Configuration

I need help setting up my wrangler.jsonc file for a Cloudflare AI application that uses:
Workers AI with Llama 3.3 70B model
Durable Objects for conversation memory
No external API dependencies
Free tier optimization

What should my configuration look like and what are the key settings I need?


### Durable Objects Migration Setup
I'm getting deployment errors about Durable Object class names. My template created "MyDurableObject" but I want to use "ChatMemory". Help me understand:

How to properly rename Durable Object classes

Migration configuration syntax

How to avoid deployment failures when changing class names


## Core Implementation

### AI Model Integration
Help me implement Cloudflare Workers AI integration with these requirements:

Use the Llama 3.3 70B model (@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast)

Maintain conversation context (last 8 messages)

Handle quota exceeded errors gracefully

Optimize for free tier (10,000 neurons/day)

Include proper system prompts for consistent behavior

Provide the core integration code and error handling patterns.


### Durable Objects Implementation
I need to implement a ChatMemory Durable Object that:

Stores conversation history persistently

Handles multiple concurrent users

Manages conversation context efficiently

Provides clear/reset functionality

Works within 5GB storage limit

Includes proper error handling

Show me the complete Durable Object class implementation.


### HTTP API Design
Since WebSocket is complex in local development, help me design an HTTP-based API for my chat application:

POST /api/chat for sending messages

GET /api/history for loading conversation

Clear conversation functionality

Proper request/response formats

Integration with Durable Objects

Provide the routing and API handling code.


## Frontend Development

### Chat Interface HTML/CSS
Create a professional chat interface for my AI assistant with:

Modern, responsive design suitable for academic presentation

Mobile-first approach

Message bubbles for user vs AI responses

Loading indicators and typing states

Connection status display

Clean, professional styling without external frameworks

Gradient backgrounds and smooth animations

Provide complete HTML structure and CSS styling.


### JavaScript Chat Application
Implement the frontend JavaScript for my chat application that:
Handles form submission and message display
Makes API calls to /api/chat and /api/history
Manages loading states and error handling
Provides smooth user experience
Auto-scrolls to new messages
Handles keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send)
Works with session-based conversation storage

Provide the complete JavaScript class implementation.

I need to optimize my application to stay within Cloudflare's free tier limits:
10,000 neurons/day for AI
100,000 requests/day for Workers
5GB storage for Durable Objects

How to monitor usage

Strategies to minimize costs

Efficient conversation context management

Provide optimization strategies and monitoring code.
